//! File ownership operations using `fchown` and `chown` syscalls
//!
//! This module provides comprehensive file ownership preservation operations using direct
//! syscalls integrated with compio's runtime for optimal performance. It supports both
//! file descriptor-based operations (preferred) and path-based operations (fallback).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! File ownership in Unix-like systems consists of two components:
//! - **User ID (UID)**: The owner of the file
//! - **Group ID (GID)**: The group that owns the file
//!
//! This module provides efficient operations to read, change, and preserve file ownership
//! using the most appropriate system calls for each scenario.
//!
//! # Operations
//!
//! ## Primary Operations
//!
//! - **`fchown`**: Change ownership using file descriptor (preferred for open files)
//! - **`chown`**: Change ownership using file path (fallback for path-based operations)
//! - **`preserve_ownership_from`**: Copy ownership from source to destination file
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//!
//! - **`fchown`**: ~2-3x faster than `chown` (no path resolution)
//! - **File descriptor operations**: Atomic and more reliable
//! - **Path operations**: More flexible but slower
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! ## Basic Ownership Change
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use compio::fs::File;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Open a file
//! let file = File::open("example.txt").await?;
//!
//! // Change ownership to user 1000, group 1000
//! file.fchown(1000, 1000).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Ownership Preservation During Copy
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use compio::fs::File;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Open source and destination files
//! let src_file = File::open("source.txt").await?;
//! let dst_file = File::create("destination.txt").await?;
//!
//! // Preserve ownership from source to destination
//! dst_file.preserve_ownership_from(&src_file).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Path-Based Ownership Change
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Change ownership using file path
//! File::chown(Path::new("example.txt"), 1000, 1000).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! All operations return `Result<(), ExtendedError>` and handle common error scenarios:
//!
//! - **Permission denied**: When not root and not file owner
//! - **Invalid UID/GID**: When the specified user/group doesn't exist
//! - **File not found**: When the file path doesn't exist (path operations only)
//! - **Cross-filesystem issues**: When UID/GID doesn't exist on destination filesystem
//!
//! ## Graceful Error Handling
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use compio::fs::File;
//!
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let file = File::open("example.txt").await?;
//!
//! // Attempt to change ownership, handle errors gracefully
//! match file.fchown(1000, 1000).await {
//!     Ok(_) => println!("Ownership changed successfully"),
//!     Err(e) => {
//!         println!("Failed to change ownership: {}", e);
//!         // Continue with other operations...
//!     }
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Security Considerations
//!
//! - **Root privileges**: Only root can change ownership to arbitrary UID/GID
//! - **File ownership**: Users can only change ownership of files they own
//! - **Group membership**: Users can change group ownership to groups they belong to
//! - **Cross-filesystem**: UID/GID must exist on the destination filesystem
//!
//! # Performance Notes
//!
//! - **File descriptor operations**: Use `fchown` when you have an open file descriptor
//! - **Path operations**: Use `chown` only when file descriptor is not available
//! - **Batch operations**: Consider batching ownership changes for multiple files
//! - **Error handling**: Implement graceful degradation for permission errors
//!
//! # Thread Safety
//!
//! All operations are thread-safe and can be used concurrently. The underlying
//! system calls are atomic and thread-safe.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Complete File Copy with Ownership Preservation
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use compio::fs::{File, OpenOptions};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! async fn copy_file_with_ownership(src: &Path, dst: &Path) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     // Open source and destination files
//!     let src_file = File::open(src).await?;
//!     let mut dst_file = OpenOptions::new()
//!         .write(true)
//!         .create(true)
//!         .truncate(true)
//!         .open(dst)
//!         .await?;
//!
//!     // Copy file content (implementation depends on your copy method)
//!     // ... copy logic here ...
//!
//!     // Preserve ownership from source to destination
//!     dst_file.preserve_ownership_from(&src_file).await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Batch Ownership Changes
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use compio_fs_extended::OwnershipOps;
//! use compio::fs::File;
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! async fn change_ownership_batch(files: &[&Path], uid: u32, gid: u32) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     for file_path in files {
//!         match File::chown(file_path, uid, gid).await {
//!             Ok(_) => println!("Changed ownership of {}", file_path.display()),
//!             Err(e) => println!("Failed to change ownership of {}: {}", file_path.display(), e),
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

    ///
    /// - **Success case**: When ownership change succeeds (root or file owner)
    /// - **Permission denied**: When not root and not file owner (expected)
    /// - **Invalid UID/GID**: When specified user/group doesn't exist
    /// - **File not found**: When the file path doesn't exist

    ///
    /// - **Root context**: Ownership change should succeed
    /// - **User context**: May fail with permission denied (expected)
    /// - **Invalid UID/GID**: Should fail with appropriate error
    /// - **File not found**: Should fail with appropriate error
