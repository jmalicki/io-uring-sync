## Contributing to Research

Research documents are living documents. To contribute:

1. **Add findings**: Update with new benchmark data, algorithm analysis, or protocol details
2. **Challenge assumptions**: If research conclusions seem incorrect, document why
3. **Add references**: Link to papers, RFCs, blog posts, or implementations
4. **Update status**: Mark completed research phases, update benchmarks for new hardware

Research documents should be:
- **Well-sourced**: Include links to papers, RFCs, implementations
- **Dated**: Note when research was conducted (hardware/software context matters)
- **Versioned**: Track major changes to research conclusions
- **Honest**: Document both successes and dead-ends
