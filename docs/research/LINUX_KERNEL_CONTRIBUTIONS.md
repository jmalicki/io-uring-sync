# Linux Kernel io_uring Contributions

## Executive Summary

This document outlines potential contributions to the Linux kernel io_uring subsystem to add missing operations that would benefit the Rust async filesystem ecosystem. These contributions would not only help our `compio-fs-extended` project but also benefit the entire Linux ecosystem.

## Current io_uring Operations Analysis

### Existing Operations (Well Supported)
- **File I/O**: read, write, readv, writev, pread, pwrite
- **File Operations**: open, close, statx, fstat, lstat
- **Directory Operations**: mkdirat, unlinkat, renameat2
- **Metadata**: fchmod, fchown, utimensat, futimens
- **Extended Attributes**: getxattr, setxattr, listxattr, removexattr
- **Synchronization**: fsync, fdatasync, sync_file_range
- **Memory**: mmap, munmap, madvise

### Missing Operations (High Impact)
1. **copy_file_range** - Critical for efficient file copying
2. **splice** - Zero-copy operations
3. **getdents64** - Async directory traversal
4. **fadvise** - File access pattern optimization
5. **fallocate** - File preallocation
6. **mknod/mkfifo** - Device file operations
